# 🌌 Planet & Star Search Simulations

## 📖 Project Description
This project is focused on **planet/star search simulations**.  
The goal is to **find and explore GitHub repositories** with star/planet tracking codes in Python, run them locally, and then **adapt them into an Object-Oriented (OOP) based system**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Discover and analyze existing open-source planet/star tracking code.  
- Run and test those repositories locally.  
- Refactor/adapt useful parts into a clean **OOP structure**.  
- Provide a simple interface for user inputs (select a planet or star).  
- Visualize the search and tracking results.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**  
- Libraries: `skyfield`

---

## 🚀 Planned Features
- OOP classes for ephemeris loading, celestial objects, tracking, and visualization.  
- CLI interface for quick simulations.  
- Optional GUI for easy object selection.  
- Export of results (CSV, plots).
