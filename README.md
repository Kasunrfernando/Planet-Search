# 🌌 Planet Search Simulations
This project is focused on **planet/star search simulations**.  
The goal is to **find and explore GitHub repositories** with planet tracking codes in Python, run them locally, and then **adapt them into an Object-Oriented (OOP) based system**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Discover and analyze existing open-source planet tracking code.  
- Run and test those repositories locally.  
- Refactor/adapt useful parts into a clean **OOP structure**.  
- Provide a simple interface for user inputs (select a planet or star).  
- Visualize the search and tracking results.
